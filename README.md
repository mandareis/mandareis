- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an app that allows you to explore exotic places to travel to and a cute weather app that tells you the hourly weather and 
forecast for the next three days. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, and React Native.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once moved to New York City because I wanted to, without a job or a place to live and landed a job and found an apartment within three weeks of being there.
